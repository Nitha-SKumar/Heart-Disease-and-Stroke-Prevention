# Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a heart disease and stroke prevention dataset to predict and detect the presence of heart disease and associated risk factors using machine-learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System and is available on Kaggle. It provides a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and associated risk factors in the United States.

## Problem Definition
The primary objective is to study the heart disease dataset and develop models to predict and detect the presence of heart disease and associated risk factors. This will help in understanding the key indicators and contributing factors to CVDs, ultimately aiding in prevention and early detection.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes over 85,800 records and 29 attributes, organized by location (national, regional, state, and selected sites) and indicators related to CVDs and risk factors.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Analyze the structure and distribution of the data.
   - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
3. **Text Preprocessing:** 
   - Clean and preprocess the data.
4. **Feature Extraction:** Extract meaningful features for model building.
5. **Model Development:** Build machine learning models to predict heart disease and stroke risks.
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
6. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance and refine as needed.
7. **Deployment:** Develop a system to automate predictions for new data.
